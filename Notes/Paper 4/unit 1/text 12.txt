Q12) Elaborate on controlled statement used in perl

Loop control statements change the execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
Perl supports the following control statements. Click the following links to check their detail.
Sr.No.	Control Statement & Description
1	next statement
It causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.
2	last statement
Terminates the loop statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.
3	continue statement
A continue BLOCK, it is always executed just before the conditional is about to be evaluated again.
4	redo statement
The redo command restarts the loop block without evaluating the conditional again. The continue block, if any, is not executed.
5	goto statement
Perl supports a goto command with three forms: goto label, goto expr, and goto &name
