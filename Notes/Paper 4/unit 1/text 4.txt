Q4) Difference between single and doubles quotes in perl

Single Quote Strings
In Perl, when a string has single quote, it means everything is treated as a literal mere text. Even if it is the name of a variable.
Example:

# Single Quote Strings

$x = 5;
$my_name = 'Include help $x';

print $my_name;

Output:
Include help $x


As you can see from the example above, the variable name $x has been displayed just by its name $x.


Double Quote Strings
Run the above example with double quotes and see the output.
Example:

# Double Quote Strings

$x = 5;
$my_name = "Include help $x";

print $my_name;

Output:
Include help 5


The difference between single and double-quotes is that double quotes insert variables and special characters such as newlines \n, whereas a single quote does not insert any variable or special character.
