Q5) what is Scalar Operator in perl elaborate on its type.

There are following miscellaneous operators supported by Perl language. Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20 then −

Sr.No.	Operator & Description
1	.
Binary operator dot (.) concatenates two strings.
Example − If $a = "abc", $b = "def" then $a.$b will give "abcdef"
2	x
The repetition operator x returns a string consisting of the left operand repeated the number of times specified by the right operand.
Example − ('-' x 3) will give ---.
3	..
The range operator .. returns a list of values counting (up by ones) from the left value to the right value
Example − (2..5) will give (2, 3, 4, 5)
4	++
Auto Increment operator increases integer value by one
Example − $a++ will give 11
5	--
Auto Decrement operator decreases integer value by one
Example − $a-- will give 9
6	->
The arrow operator is mostly used in dereferencing a method or variable from an object or a class name
Example − $obj->$a is an example to access variable $a from object $obj


Example

Try the following example to understand all the miscellaneous operators available in Perl. Copy and paste the following Perl program in test.pl file and execute this program.

#!/usr/local/bin/perl

$a = "abc";
$b = "def";

print "Value of \$a  = $a and value of \$b = $b\n";
 
$c = $a . $b;
print "Value of \$a . \$b = $c\n";

$c = "-" x 3;
print "Value of \"-\" x 3 = $c\n";

@c = (2..5);
print "Value of (2..5) = @c\n";

$a = 10;
$b = 15;
print "Value of \$a  = $a and value of \$b = $b\n";

$a++;
$c = $a ;
print "Value of \$a after \$a++ = $c\n";

$b--;
$c = $b ;
print "Value of \$b after \$b-- = $c\n";


When the above code is executed, it produces the following result −

Output:

Value of $a = abc and value of $b = def
Value of $a . $b = abcdef
Value of "-" x 3 = ---
Value of (2..5) = 2 3 4 5
Value of $a = 10 and value of $b = 15
Value of $a after $a++ = 11
Value of $b after $b-- = 14
