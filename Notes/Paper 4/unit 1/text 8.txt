Q8) what is an array and explain its advantages and disadvantages and its uses.

An array is a variable that stores an ordered list of scalar values. Array variables are preceded by an "at" (@) sign. To refer to a single element of an array, you will use the dollar sign ($) with the variable name followed by the index of the element in square brackets.


Here is a simple example of using the array variables

Example:
@ages = (25, 30, 40);             
@names = ("John Paul", "Lisa", "Kumar");

print "\$ages[0] = $ages[0]\n";
print "\$ages[1] = $ages[1]\n";
print "\$ages[2] = $ages[2]\n";
print "\$names[0] = $names[0]\n";
print "\$names[1] = $names[1]\n";
print "\$names[2] = $names[2]\n";

Here we have used the escape sign (\) before the $ sign just to print it. Other Perl will understand it as a variable and will print its value. When executed, this will produce the following result −

Output :

$ages[0] = 25
$ages[1] = 30
$ages[2] = 40
$names[0] = John Paul
$names[1] = Lisa
$names[2] = Kumar



Advantages of using Array in Perl
Below are the advantages are as follows.
	•	Multiple data items are accessed by using an array.
	•	Using array we can save the memory.
	•	Using an array in Perl debugging of code is easy.
	•	It is efficient to declare array while defining a single element.
	•	The array is used to help increase the reusability of code.


Disadvantages of array:
	•	The size of the array should be known in advance.
	•	The array is a static data structure with a fixed size so, the size of the array cannot be modified further and hence no modification can be done during runtime.
	•	Insertion and deletion operations are costly in arrays as elements are stored in contiguous memory.
	•	If the size of the declared array is more than the required size then, it can lead to memory wastage. 

Uses of array


In Perl, array is a special type of variable. The array is used to store the list of values and each object of the list is termed as an element. Elements can either be a number, string, or any type of scalar data including another variable.
