Q3) what is match operator and explain its modifiers.


       The Match Operator
The match operator, m//, is used to match a string or statement to a regular expression. For example, to match the character sequence "foo" against the scalar $bar, you might use a statement like this âˆ’

Example:
$bar = "This is foo and again foo";
if ($bar =~ /foo/) {
   print "First time is matching\n";
} else {
   print "First time is not matching\n";
}

Output:
First time is matching

Match Operator Modifiers
              The match operator supports its own set of modifiers. The /g modifier allows for global matching. The /i modifier will make the match case insensitive. Here is the complete list of modifiers

Sr.No.	Modifier & Description
1	i
Makes the match case insensitive.
2	m
Specifies that if the string has newline or carriage return characters, the ^ and $ operators will now match against a newline boundary, instead of a string boundary.
3	o
Evaluates the expression only once.
4	s
Allows use of . to match a newline character.
5	x
Allows you to use white space in the expression for clarity.
6	g
Globally finds all matches.
7	cg
Allows the search to continue even after a global match fails
