Metacharacters

A metacharacter is a character that has a special meaning during pattern processing. You use metacharacters in regular expressions to define the search criteria and any text manipulations.

Metacharacters	Description	Example
^	This character is used to match an expression to its right at the start of a string.	^a is an expression match to the string which starts with 'a' such as "aab", "a9c", "apr", "aaaaab", etc.
$	The $sign is used to match an expression to its left at the end of a string.	r$ is an expression match to a string which ends with r such as "aaabr", "ar", "r", "aannn9r", etc.
.	This character is used to match any single character in a string except the line terminator, i.e. /n.	b.x is an expression that match strings such as "bax", "b9x", "bar".
|	It is used to match a particular character or a group of characters on either side. If the character on the left side is matched, then the right side's character is ignored.	A|b is an expression which gives various strings, but each string contains either a or b.
\	It is used to escape a special character after this sign in a string.	
A	It is used to match the character 'A' in the string.	This expression matches those strings in which at least one-time A is present. Such strings are "Amcx", "mnAr", "mnopAx4".
Ab	It is used to match the substring 'ab' in the string.	This expression matches those strings in which 'Ab' is present at least one time. Such strings are "Abcx", "mnAb", "mnopAbx4"
