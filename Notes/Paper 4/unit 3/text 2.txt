Q2) what do you mean by file handling? Explain file operation used in file handling.

File handling is the most important part in any programming language. A filehandle is an internal Perl structure that associates with a file name.
Perl File handling is important as it is helpful in accessing file such as text files, log files or configuration files.
Perl filehandles are capable of creating, reading, opening and closing a file.

In Perl, a FileHandle associates a name to an external file, that can be used until the end of the program or until the FileHandle is closed. In short, a FileHandle is like a connection that can be used to modify the contents of an external file and a name is given to the connection (the FileHandle) for faster access and ease.


The three basic FileHandles in Perl are STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR, which represent Standard Input, Standard Output, and Standard Error devices respectively.

File Handling is usually done through the open function.
Syntax: open(FileHandle, Mode, FileName);
Parameters:
	•	FileHandle- The reference to the file, that can be used within the program or until its closure.
	•	Mode- Mode in which a file is to be opened.
	•	FileName- The name of the file to be opened.

The FileHandle is closed using the close function.
Syntax: close(FileHandle); Parameters:
	•	FileHandle- The FileHandle to be closed.
