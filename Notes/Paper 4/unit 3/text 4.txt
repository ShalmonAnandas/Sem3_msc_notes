Q4) elaborate on minus D. And globe function.

Perl functions and subroutines are used to reuse a code in a program. You can use a function at several places in your application with different parameters.
There is only one difference in function and subroutine, subroutine is created with sub keyword and it returns a value. You can divide your code into separate subroutines. Logically each function in each division should perform a specific task.


glob() function in Perl is used to print the files present in a directory passed to it as an argument. This function can print all or the specific files whose extension has been passed to it.

Syntax: glob(Directory_name/File_type);
Parameter: path of the directory of which files are to be printed.
Returns: the list of files present in the given directory.


Example 1: Printing names of all the files in the directory
#!/usr/bin/perl 
  
# To store the files 
# from the directory in the array 
@files = glob('C:/Users/GeeksForGeeks/Folder/*'); 

  
# Printing the created array 
print "@files\n"

Above example will print all the files of the requested directory.
