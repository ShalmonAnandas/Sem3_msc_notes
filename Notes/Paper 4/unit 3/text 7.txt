	2.	SeqIO:

	3.	AlignIo:

AlignIO is patterned on the object and its commands have many of the same names as the commands in . Just as in the object can be created with -file and -format 

Example:

use Bio::AlignIO; my $io = Bio::AlignIO->new(
                         -file => "receptors.aln",
                         -format => "clustalw" );


Bio::AlignIO reads many formats but does not write in every format (the same is true for Bio::SeqIO). AlignIO currently supports output in these formats:
	•	fasta
	•	mase
	•	selex
	•	clustalw
	•	msf
	•	phylip
	•	po
	•	stockholm
	•	XMFA
	•	metafasta

Bio::AlignIO objects can be produced by bioperl-run alignment creation objects (e.g. Clustalw.pm, BLAST’s bl2seq, TCoffee.pm, and Lagan.pm or they can be read in from files of multiple-sequence alignments in various formats using AlignIO.
