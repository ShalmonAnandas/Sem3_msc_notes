Q5) advantages and disadvantages of Mongo DB

Advantages of MongoDB over RDBMS
	•	Schema less − MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. Number of fields, content and size of the document can differ from one document to another.
	•	Structure of a single object is clear.
	•	No complex joins.
	•	Deep query-ability. MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language that's nearly as powerful as SQL.
	•	Tuning.
	•	Ease of scale-out − MongoDB is easy to scale.
	•	Conversion/mapping of application objects to database objects not needed.
	•	Uses internal memory for storing the (windowed) working set, enabling faster access of data.
Why Use MongoDB?
	•	Document Oriented Storage − Data is stored in the form of JSON style documents.
	•	Index on any attribute
	•	Replication and high availability
	•	Auto-Sharding
	•	Rich queries
	•	Fast in-place updates
	•	Professional support by MongoDB
Where to Use MongoDB?
	•	Big Data
	•	Content Management and Delivery
	•	Mobile and Social Infrastructure
	•	User Data Management
	•	Data Hub
